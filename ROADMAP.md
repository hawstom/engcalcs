# Introduction

This is a prioritized, bulleted roadmap for the EngCalcs hydraulic calculator suite.

The format of each task is: Priority/status|Description. 0 means "Completed" and 100 means top priority. Ties (same priority for multiple tasks) are okay. Any whole number 0-100 can be used. Tasks are sorted highest priority first; completed tasks are at the bottom.

# Tasks

- 50|Clean stale remote branch `origin/Solver` and remove any conflict-marker files left in master. The Solver branch was merged/abandoned; leaving it creates confusion for future contributors.

- 20|Set up npm (package.json) and/or Composer for dependency management. Deferred from dev-infra work; currently Bootstrap and other assets are manually vendored.

- 10|TypeScript migration — convert `lib/Calculators.lib.js` and per-calculator files to `.ts`. Only worthwhile if the project scope grows significantly.

- 10|Server-side calculation fallback — duplicate JS calc logic in PHP so results can be generated without JavaScript (accessibility, search indexing). High effort, low urgency.

- 10|Results sharing — generate a shareable URL or printable summary of a completed calculation. Nice-to-have feature.

## Completed

- 0|Moved `EngCalcs.Sketch` from `js/calculators/manning-irregular.js` into `lib/Manning.lib.js` so it can be reused by the irregular weir calculator without duplication.

- 0|Bootstrap 5.3.2 migration and jQuery removal. All pages converted to Bootstrap 5 utility classes; `$()` calls eliminated. (commit 92f38da)

- 0|Extracted per-calculator JavaScript into separate files under `js/calculators/`. Reduces inline script bloat in PHP files. (commit 76d6255)

- 0|Added CLAUDE.md architecture and developer guide. Documents bootstrap flow, prefix convention, unit sets, key files, and roadmap. (commit 61cf0dc)

- 0|Added php -l pre-commit hook to catch PHP syntax errors before commit. (commit 61cf0dc)

- 0|Priority 1 security fixes: XSS output escaping, language parameter validation, cookie Secure/HttpOnly flags, ENV-based DEBUG_MODE, removed test/debug files. (commit 5e807c6)
