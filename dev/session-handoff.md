# Session handoff

Read this before the roadmap. RULINGS and TRAPS are standing; STATE is dated, so delete a STATE line
once it is no longer true. Anything already in `CLAUDE.md` is not repeated here. Replace stale
lines rather than appending corrections.

---

## Before merging anything

- **Protected branches alive, each awaiting Tom's browser pass** (`feature_freeze` is OFF; every one
  is listed in `dev/branch-policy.json`, which until 2026-09-30 named none of them): see STATE below.
  Plus `feat/label-placer` (the seam; round-5 bench), `feat/label-gang-search` (bench only), and
  builders `feat/label-placer-a`..`-d`, which never merge alone.
- **A branch that adds a key fails `payload freshness` and only that**, by design: agents never
  regenerate `dev/translation_payloads/`. Regenerate once on the merge commit, then run the suite.
- The all-clear's pin field in `dev/branch-all-clears.json` is **`head`**. Tom can test a preview
  mid-build, so pin to the final head and say so in `pin_note`.
- **Merge master into a branch before merging it to master**, then run the suite on the merge:
  2026-09-23 twice showed a clean merge breaking a harness (the lag harness and Net3's threshold).
- **Never wrap `run_harnesses.sh` or `check_all.sh` in the browser lock**: each browser harness
  takes that lock itself, so the wrapper deadlocks every one (2026-09-25, 280 s NOT RUN apiece).
  Brief agents to write journals to the scratchpad while a suite runs in the main checkout.
- Since 2026-10-02 (jasmine, 24 threads) `check_all.sh` runs four suites at once in slots, ~8 min
  each; run it with no outer flock. A branch cut before `f9829cee` still uses the single browser lock,
  so its browser harnesses can print `NOT RUN` under load: merge master into it first.

## RULINGS

- The interface says **Customer**, never Meter.
- Don't expose the word "projection". **Georeferencing** means attaching the world map, not
  converting the coordinate system (`dev/tom-coordinate-vocabulary-2026-09-16.md`).
- We align the streets with the project, never the project with the streets.
- `isLatLonProject()` answers only "are these latitudes and longitudes"; most callers want
  `projectLocatable()`. Do not widen the name back.
- Delete a language key when nothing renders it and nothing checks it, and say which ones.
- **Tell Tom about:** any change to what is stored on a visitor's device; any public claim on the
  landing page; anything needing his testing or approval before a merge.
- Run `git status` at the start of a session and before acting on each of his messages. His own
  edits arrive uncommitted.
- Make his wording changes, not yours. Don't ship something he has questioned.
- **Never hand him local-dev housekeeping** (worktrees, branches, ports, leaked servers). He has no
  worktrees on production; his commands are `git pull` there and the Apache reload here. If the
  classifier refuses a local cleanup, say so and ask him to allow it, never phrase it as his step.

## TRAPS

- **The Mapbox token is restricted by host.** Allowed hosts include `localhost` and `hawsedc.local`,
  so a new preview port needs nothing; a new hostname does, and `127.0.0.1` is refused (403). A token being present is not a token
  being accepted — test with a real tile request.
- **A clean merge can still break the tree** (a rename on one side, an old call on the other). That
  is why the suite runs on the merge commit.
- **`check_all.sh` stamps only a clean tree**, and pre-push refuses an unstamped master commit.
  Commit, then run. Pre-commit refuses a non-merge commit on master.
- **Never `git worktree remove --force`** without reading its `git status` first; it once destroyed
  an agent's uncommitted work.
- **Check that no agent is already working in a worktree before sending another in.**
- **An orphaned probe can hold `/tmp/engcalcs-browser.lock` for hours**, and every browser harness in
  every suite then times out (2026-09-23: a pre-reviewer's hung phone test). Find the holder with
  `for p in /proc/[0-9]*; do ls -l $p/fd 2>/dev/null | grep -q engcalcs-browser.lock && echo $p; done`.
  The divider harness now prints `NOT RUN` when this happens instead of failing silently.
- **An agent's report of "committed" is a claim.** Run `git status` in its worktree before you
  merge; one branch's two harnesses were reported committed and were untracked.
- **A usage limit kills every running agent at once**; only their commits survive. Brief agents to
  commit as they go, and relaunch with "read `git log master..HEAD` first".
- **Preview ports live on jasmine since 2026-10-02**: `~/webdev/worktrees/_panel/ports.conf` lists
  them (pipe rows with what to test), `sh ~/webdev/worktrees/_panel/generate.sh` makes any missing
  worktree, writes one Apache vhost per row and reloads Apache (passwordless via
  `/etc/sudoers.d/previews`; a crontab `@reboot` reruns it). They bind to loopback; Tom reaches them through SSH forwarding, so his browser sees `localhost` (secure
  context, and a host the Mapbox token accepts). A new port needs a new `LocalForward` line on his
  side. Apache honours `.htaccess`; jasmine and production both run PHP 8.5 (2026-10-03).
- **Ask which branch a host is on before explaining what Tom sees.** `dev.hawsedc.com` has sat on
  an old feature branch; `curl` gets a 401 there. Answer about the surface he named.

---

- **A worktree's `check_all` never stamps**, because its `.git` is a file; a master push needs its
  own run in the main checkout. And never switch the main checkout's branch while its run is queued.
- **The roadmap lags the code.** 2026-09-26 two agents were briefed on Tasks 708 and 696 and found
  both already shipped. Run `git log --oneline --all --grep=<task>` before briefing one.
- **A check whose "before" run reads `master` breaks the merge that fixes it**; pin a SHA.

- **A stub harness can pass over the very defect it names.** 2026-09-23 the zoom-control harness
  emptied the document, so "Tom's exact sequence" passed while the real page went blank, and the
  build agent then told us Tom had tested an old build. When a stub cannot reproduce his report,
  send the pre-reviewer to reproduce it in real Chrome before believing either side.
- **Seven agents each queueing `check_all` serialise on one lock for hours**, and an agent that
  hands back while waiting queues duplicates. Count queued runs (`/proc/*/fd` on the lock) before
  launching another track.

- **`git stash` is ONE stack shared by every worktree.** 2026-09-24 one agent's `stash pop` took
  another worktree's entry. Never stash while agents are live; brief them so.
- **Ten check_all runs queued at once took four hours to drain** (2026-09-24, ~20 min each). A
  run's pass is judged on the tree at its END, so an agent that edits while queued re-queues.
  Stagger build tracks rather than launching seven together.
- **The browser-pass harness leaks its `php -S` server when killed**; 14 from 09-23 were still
  running on 09-24. `ps -eo pid,ppid,lstart,args | grep 'S 127.0.0.1'`, kill those whose parent is 1/449.
- **Flaky under load, green alone:** `run-progress-harness.js`; `dev/browser-pass/specs/basemap.js` and `firstproject.js`
  tile counts at a 900 ms settle. Pre-existing and unrelated: `scale-publish-harness.js` (2 checks),
  `dev/browser-pass/specs/place.js` (stale "lat/lon project now"; section 17 filechooser order),
  `dev/browser-pass/specs/visibility.js` (stale sub-heading list; "Escape closes it"). Browser-pass specs are not in
  check_all.

## STATE — 2026-10-02 (first day on jasmine)

### Master = bb9b901e, pushed. Production = 9c71d54f (Tom pulled 2026-09-28)

Master since 05eac4a3 carries: the 67 concept definitions (737's open item; projection-map corrected
to his 09-14 ruling), check_all in four slots (`f9829cee`), the widened panel guard (701 closed),
747 closed (shipped with copy-lock). Review queue R-370..R-378 is his 2026-10-02 pass.

### Awaiting his browser pass (protected; merge on his all-clear, typed by him in a session)

Every branch below has master merged in (2026-10-02) and a suite run on it; "green" = only the
expected `payload freshness`. Ask for merges with AskUserQuestion.
- 8106 `feat/property-graph` (637, R-370, R-377): pump reads "Head", prefix "H="; Full report/CSV
  column "Pump head" (new key `lpn_report_pump_head`). Time series: held values step forward, others
  slope (`TS_STEPPED`). Owed: his OK on "Head" and "Pump head" (rulings were keyed on "Head gain").
- 8107 `feat/criticality` (751, R-371): rows in fire flow's tiers and tints. Owed: syn diff for
  `lpn_ff_all`/`_selected` (drop the Design-check sentence) and proposed `lpn_ff_design_*` syn entries.
  `lpn_crit_skipped` ("{n} selected elements are not links") still plural-agrees; not fixed.
- 8110 `feat/demand-scaling` (754, R-374): contains criticality (merged 3d090fc3), so merging it merges
  both. Find was always scoped; it now SAYS "Only the selected junctions were scaled", and a refused
  Selected run clears the old answer in the box (fire flow and criticality too). New wording to rule:
  "Junctions not shown: {n}." (was "{n} more junctions are not shown.") and "Links not shown: {n}."
- 8108 `feat/bentley-interop` (749, R-372): "Alt. preview is good" — nothing to build; needs only his word.
- 8109 `feat/graph-menu` (640, R-373): Profile row icon removed; tip is his text verbatim. The rows
  still read "Time series" / "Frequency" against his tip's "Time Series" / "Frequency distribution".
- 8112 `feat/keyboard-menu` (748): Perry passed it bar one defect (focus lost after Enter), fixed;
  RTL mirrors Left/Right.
- 8111 `feat/drawing-keep` (680): Perry found returns drawn at the previous project's zoom; fixed
  (2b47ebe9) with a harness across scales. Keeps up to four drawings.
- 8113 `feat/property-arrow-key` (Declan's wish 3): Up/Down walk the Properties fields.
- `feat/desktop` (756): his ruling R-375 — usage logs ON in a desktop build, reported to hawsedc.com;
  write it into `dev/desktop-platforms-plan.md` (a fifth outside call: consent and privacy paragraph).
- `feat/label-placer` (539/741): unchanged.

- 8114 `fix/undo-label`: there was no Redo; now Ctrl+Y and Ctrl+Shift+Z (not Cmd+Y, the Mac's
  History), a new edit empties it, and Undo keeps the Properties box open. Held for his pass because it
  is new behaviour. The Help box's shortcut list lacks the Redo row: adding it needs his OK on "Ctrl+Y
  or Ctrl+Shift+Z | Redo the last undone change." and a translation pass (the markup check needs all 27).

### Owed translation work

Unchanged from 10-01 plus: property-graph 2 keys renamed/1 new, demand-scaling 1 new and
`lpn_ff_rows_more` reworded. Sprint after his merges, not before: the branch keys are most of it.

Run a sprint after this batch merges: property-graph 4 keys, criticality ~29, bentley-interop 13,
graph-menu 2, demand-scaling ~42. Romanian file menu noun/verb pass. Concept layer: 67 empty
definitions. Glossary write-back owed from echo (see 09-30).

### Traps met 2026-10-02

- **Ctrl+C in his terminal stops every background agent**, and the harness then refuses SendMessage
  to them. Only his word relaunches them; fresh agents resumed from each branch's commits fine.
- **A merge of master into a branch can fail the new panel guard** on that branch's own undeclared
  show/hide (property-graph's `propGraphSync`): declare it in `panel-touch-harness.js`, do not hide it.
- **Running `new_english_keys.php --write` while a merge is unresolved exits 2 and writes nothing**;
  resolve, commit, then regenerate and commit again.

### Traps met 2026-10-01

- **Two runs per branch queue up when an agent hands back while its run waits, and the classifier
  refuses CC killing a queued waiter.** Brief agents to detach ONE run with a unique log name.
- **`start-fresh-consent-harness.js` flakes under load** ("the banner is showing again"); 11/11 alone.
- **Closing roadmap tasks makes `dev/features.md` stale**: regenerate with `generate_features.php`.

### Traps met 2026-09-30 (night)

- **The machine restarted mid-session** (kernel changed; scratchpad wiped; a master run lost). Every
  agent had committed, so nothing was lost; branches are now also pushed to GitHub as backup.
- **CC force-regenerated `dev/new-english-keys.md` in the main checkout without first checking it for
  his uncommitted edits.** He may have lost an edit. Before ANY `--force`: `git status` and `git diff`
  on that file in that checkout, and harvest first.
- **A long check_all queue gets a background command killed at its time limit.** Start master's run
  detached (`setsid nohup sh -c '...; echo EXIT=$? >> LOG'`) and wait with `dev/scripts/wait_for.sh`.

### Traps met 2026-09-30 (evening)

- **`flock` is not a queue.** With seven suites waiting, master's run waited over two hours while branch
  runs kept winning the lock. Merge master's batch early, before launching branch builds.
- **An agent ran `git stash`/`pop` again** (graph-tab-keys) and applied another branch's stash; it reset
  its own tree and the stash list survived. The rule is in every brief and still broke.
- **A forced `new_english_keys.php --write --force` is safe only when the file equals master's generated
  copy** (`git diff master -- dev/new-english-keys.md` empty). Check that first, every time.
- **Bentley is not ours** (Tom): their scenarios are a tree over alternatives; their criticality and
  on-the-fly analyses run on a copy. He has no WaterCAD.

### Traps met 2026-09-30

- **The auto-mode classifier refuses CC writing an all-clear taken from a pasted message.** Ask him to
  type the merge word in the session itself.
- **The label bench's parallel scorers (3 x node at 3 GB) saturate 4 cores and once filled the 6 GB
  RAM-backed /tmp**; every check_all then took 1-3 hours. Brief the label agent to run on disk
  (`/home/haws/label-trials-work`, 1.1 GB, reproducible) and with one worker while suites queue.
- **His hand edits to `dev/new-english-keys.md` reach master uncommitted-then-committed and fail
  "english rulings harvested" on every branch** until harvested: harvest first thing, and fix a bullet
  that lost its `- ` so the parser reads it.
- **A branch's check_all can go green but for a failure master has already fixed** (the Shift-hint JS
  fallback): read the failure before re-running.

### Traps met 2026-09-29

- **Worktrees had no `dev/browser-pass/node_modules`**, so 10 browser harnesses failed "playwright-core
  is not installed" and read like defects. Symlink the main checkout's into each new worktree.
- **Perry ran `git stash pop`** despite the rule and pulled another session's stash into a worktree;
  a translator edited the main checkout by mistake and reverted it. Put "never stash, never touch the
  main checkout" in EVERY brief, reviewers included.
- **`/engcalcs/` absolute paths work on every host**; only RELATIVE ones break under `/app/`. Do
  not "fix" an absolute `/engcalcs/` path for librewaternet.org.

### Traps met 2026-09-28/29

- **A broad `pkill -f check_all.sh` kills every session's run** (an agent did it; master's run died
  with 144). Brief agents: kill only by PID, and only their own.
- **Network drops (EAI_AGAIN) kill agents mid-work**; resume with SendMessage, "git status first".
- **The four gallery FAIL lines in example-open-guard-harness are its own mutation tests**; the
  verdict is the exit code. Read `FAILED:` lines, not raw FAIL lines.
- **Agents writing journals into the main checkout dirty a running suite.** Brief them to the
  scratchpad while a suite runs there.
- **The master pre-commit refuses `--amend` too**: regenerate payloads on a chore branch and merge.

## Commands to hand Tom with any panel change

Nothing, normally. His Windows ssh config (`C:\Users\tomha\.ssh\config`, PowerShell's ssh)
forwards 8080, 8100-8139 and 8201-8205. Ports are reusable: give a new branch the lowest number in
8101-8139 that no `ports.conf` row holds. Windows' ssh dies past about 120 forwards, so never grow
that pool past ~60. His WSL tab runs a different ssh that carries no forwards.
